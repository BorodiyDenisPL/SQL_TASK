Write a query that will calculate the number of shipments per month. The unique key for one shipment is a combination of shipment_id and sub_id. Output the year_month in format YYYY-MM and the number of shipments in that month.

Table: amazon_shipment


SELECT 
    CONCAT(YEAR(shipment_date), '-', RIGHT('0' + CAST(MONTH(shipment_date) AS VARCHAR(2)), 2)) AS year_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(shipment_id AS VARCHAR), '-', CAST(sub_id AS VARCHAR))) AS shipment_count
FROM 
    amazon_shipment
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(shipment_date),
    MONTH(shipment_date)
ORDER BY 
    YEAR(shipment_date),
    MONTH(shipment_date);
